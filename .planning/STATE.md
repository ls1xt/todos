## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Files over database: grep is the query engine; markdown survives any tooling change
- Status via directories: moving a file changes status; no metadata to sync
- Non-interactive safety: scripts must not block on $EDITOR or TTY input
